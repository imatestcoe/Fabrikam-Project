# üîÑ GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains the core CI workflows for the Fabrikam project. **Deployment workflows are automatically created by Azure Portal's Deployment Center.**

## üìã **Current Workflows**

### üß™ **`testing.yml`** - Continuous Integration
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`develop`, Pull Requests to `main`
- **Purpose**: Runs automated tests to ensure code quality
- **Actions**: Build solution, run unit tests, validate integration tests
- **Status**: Always runs on code changes

### üîê **`authentication-validation.yml`** - Security Validation  
- **Triggers**: Pull Requests affecting auth code, Manual dispatch
- **Purpose**: Security analysis and authentication pattern validation
- **Actions**: Security scanning, auth flow validation, vulnerability checks
- **Status**: Runs on auth-related changes

## üöÄ **Deployment Workflows** (Auto-Generated)

When you set up CI/CD via **Azure Portal > Deployment Center**, Azure automatically creates deployment workflows with names like:
- `main_fabrikam-api-development-[suffix].yml` (API deployment)
- `main_fabrikam-mcp-development-[suffix].yml` (MCP deployment)

### ‚ö° **Monorepo Fix Required**

**Azure Portal generates workflows with automatic authentication setup, but they need adjustment for our monorepo structure.**

**‚úÖ Recommended Process:**
1. **Let Azure generate workflows** in Deployment Center (preserves automatic secrets setup)
2. **Run our fix script** to adjust for monorepo structure:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\Fix-AzureWorkflows.ps1
   ```

**Why this approach:**
- ‚úÖ **Keep Azure's automatic secrets**: Service principals and authentication configured automatically
- ‚úÖ **Fix monorepo issues**: Script updates project paths for correct builds
- ‚úÖ **Workshop-friendly**: No manual GitHub secrets configuration required
- ‚úÖ **Best of both**: Azure's convenience + monorepo compatibility

**What the script fixes:**
- Updates `dotnet publish` commands to specify correct project paths
- Ensures `dotnet build` uses the solution file  
- Works automatically for both API and MCP services
- Creates backups before making changes

**üìñ For complete details**: See [Azure Workflow Configuration Guide](../docs/deployment/AZURE-WORKFLOW-CONFIGURATION.md)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative**: Our pre-built templates (`.github/workflow-templates/`) require manual secret setup and are better for advanced scenarios.

After fixing, these workflows provide:
- ‚úÖ Correct build paths for monorepo structure
- ‚úÖ Proper Azure credentials and service principal
- ‚úÖ Environment-specific deployment targets
- ‚úÖ Optimized build and deployment steps

## üéØ **Workshop Benefits**

This clean separation provides:
1. **CI**: Core testing and validation (runs on every change)
2. **CD**: Deployment automation (configured per environment via Portal)
3. **Clean Fork**: Workshop participants get minimal, focused workflows
4. **No Conflicts**: Portal-generated workflows don't interfere with existing ones

## üí° **For Workshop Participants**

When you fork this repository, you'll start with:
- ‚úÖ **2 essential workflows** for testing and security
- ‚úÖ **Clean slate** for deployment - Portal will add your specific deployment workflows
- ‚úÖ **No confusion** about which workflows to modify or ignore

After setting up Deployment Center, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ **4 total workflows**: 2 core + 2 deployment (API + MCP)
- ‚úÖ **All properly configured** for your specific Azure environment
- ‚úÖ **Ready for development** - make changes and watch them deploy automatically!

**üîß Technical Note**: The Portal-generated workflows are optimized for the monorepo structure and handle the `--project` flags correctly for building the right components.
