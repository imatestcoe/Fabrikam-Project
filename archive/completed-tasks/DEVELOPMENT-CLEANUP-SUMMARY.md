- `MCP-TOOLS-COMPREHENSIVE-INVENTORY.md` - Current tool inventory

## ‚úÖ **Result**

### Before Cleanup:
- **21 files** in development folder
- Mix of completed work, architecture docs, and active development
- Testing subfolder with 3 files

### After Cleanup:
- **4 files** in development folder (only active development work)
- Clean separation of concerns:
  - `/docs/development/` - Active ongoing work
  - `/docs/architecture/` - Important architectural decisions and strategies
  - `/docs/getting-started/` - Setup and configuration guides
  - `/archive/completed-tasks/` - Completed work for historical reference

## üéØ **Benefits**

1. **Clear Focus**: Development folder now contains only active, ongoing work
2. **Better Organization**: Architecture docs in proper location for future reference
3. **Easier Onboarding**: Setup guides consolidated in getting-started
4. **Clean History**: Completed work preserved but archived
5. **Reduced Clutter**: Empty or obsolete files removed

The development folder is now optimized for ongoing work with clear separation of active development from completed tasks and architectural documentation.
