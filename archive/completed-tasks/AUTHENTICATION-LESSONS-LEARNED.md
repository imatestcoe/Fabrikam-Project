// private readonly Dictionary<string, string> _demoPasswords = new()
// {
//     { "Admin", "AdminDemo123!" },
//     { "Read-Write", "ReadWrite123!" },
//     { "Read-Only", "ReadOnly123!" }
// };

// ‚úÖ NEW: Dynamic instance-specific password generation
private Dictionary<string, string> GenerateInstancePasswords(string instanceId)
{
    var passwords = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    var roles = new[] { "Admin", "Read-Write", "Read-Only", "Future-Role-A", ... };

    foreach (var role in roles)
    {
        var password = GenerateRolePassword(role, instanceId); // SHA256-based deterministic
        passwords[role] = password;
    }
    return passwords;
}
```

**Outcome**: ‚úÖ **Enhanced Security Success**

## üîß Technical Implementation Insights

### **4. Service Integration Patterns**

**Challenge**: Clean integration of authentication seeding without coupling to core services

**Solution**: Separate AuthenticationSeedService with clear boundaries

```csharp
// Clean service registration
builder.Services.AddScoped<AuthenticationSeedService>();

// Controlled startup execution
var seedService = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AuthenticationSeedService>();
await seedService.SeedAuthenticationDataAsync();
```

**Key Insights**:

- ‚úÖ **Separation of Concerns**: Seeding logic separate from authentication logic
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection**: Proper service lifetime management
- ‚úÖ **Error Isolation**: Seeding failures don't break core authentication
- ‚úÖ **Environment Safety**: Conditional execution based on environment

**Lessons Learned**:

- Keep seeding services separate from core business logic
- Use scoped services for database operations with proper cleanup
- Environment checks should be at the service level, not configuration level
- Graceful failure handling prevents startup issues

### **5. JSON Data Management**

**Challenge**: Maintainable, flexible user data management for demo scenarios

**Solution**: Structured JSON with comprehensive user profiles

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "firstName": "Lee",
      "lastName": "Gu",
      "email": "lee.gu@fabrikam.levelupcsp.com",
      "roles": ["Admin"],
      "department": "Executive Leadership",
      "title": "Chief Executive Officer",
      "location": "Seattle, WA"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Easy to modify user data without code changes
- ‚úÖ **Completeness**: Full user profiles for realistic demonstrations
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove users or modify roles
- ‚úÖ **Version Control**: User data changes tracked in source control

**Lessons Learned**:

- JSON data files provide excellent balance of structure and flexibility
- Complete user profiles enhance demonstration quality
- Realistic email addresses improve authenticity
- Clear role assignments essential for authorization testing

### **6. Development vs. Production Security**

**Challenge**: Balance security requirements with development accessibility

**Solution**: Environment-aware features with conditional execution

```csharp
// Development-only credential logging
if (_environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Demo user '{Email}' created with password: {Password}",
        email, password);
}
```

**Security Layers**:

- ‚úÖ **Environment Checks**: Development features disabled in production
- ‚úÖ **Conditional Logging**: Passwords never logged in production
- ‚úÖ **Secure Defaults**: Production-secure defaults with development overrides
- ‚úÖ **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit separation between demo and production users

**Lessons Learned**:

- Environment-based feature flags provide excellent security/usability balance
- Explicit logging statements better than configuration-based solutions
- Development features should degrade gracefully in production
- Security defaults should be production-safe with development enhancements

## üöß Implementation Challenges and Solutions
