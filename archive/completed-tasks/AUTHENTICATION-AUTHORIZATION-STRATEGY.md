## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Authentication Flow**
```
User Registration → Identity Verification → Role Assignment → Token Issuance → Resource Access
```

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Identity Provider Options**
- **Primary**: Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID)
- **Alternative**: Azure AD B2C for external users
- **Fallback**: Custom JWT implementation for isolated scenarios

#### **2. Authorization Service**
- **Role Management**: Define and assign user roles
- **Permission Mapping**: Map roles to specific API endpoints and MCP tools
- **Policy Engine**: Evaluate access requests against business rules

#### **3. Token Management**
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWT tokens for API access
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived tokens for session management
- **API Keys**: Optional alternative for programmatic access
