4. **Configure GitHub Import**
   - **Connector type**: Custom
   - **Branch**: dev
   - **Connector**: MCP-Streamable-HTTP
   - Select "**Continue**"

5. **Customize Swagger Definition for Your Authentication Mode**

   After importing, you'll see a Swagger editor. You need to customize it based on your Fabrikam deployment's authentication mode. Here's what to modify:

   #### üîì **Disabled Mode Customization** (Recommended for Initial Testing)
   
   **When to use**: Quick demos, POCs, initial testing without authentication complexity
   
   **Required Changes in Swagger Editor**:
   1. **Update host**: Change `host:` to your MCP server domain (e.g., `your-mcp-app-name.azurewebsites.net`)
   2. **Add GUID header**: Configure the `X-User-GUID` header for user tracking
   
   **üí° Domain Name Helper**: Your Azure deployment generates predictable domain names based on your resource group name:
   - **Resource Group**: `rg-fabrikamaidemo-gcpm`
   - **API Domain**: `fabrikam-api-development-gcpm.azurewebsites.net`
   - **MCP Domain**: `fabrikam-mcp-development-gcpm.azurewebsites.net`
   
   Replace the suffix (`gcpm` in this example) with your actual resource group suffix.
   
   **üÜî Generate Your GUID**:
   
   **Option 1: Fabrikam API (Recommended)**
   
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/UserRegistration/disabled-mode" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"firstName": "Demo", "lastName": "User", "email": "demo@company.com"}'
   ```
   
   This returns a response with both your GUID and a service JWT token for advanced scenarios.
   
   **Option 2: PowerShell**
   
   ```powershell
   [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
   ```
   
   **Option 3: PowerShell with API Integration**
   
   ```powershell
   $apiUrl = "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/UserRegistration/disabled-mode"
   $body = @{
       firstName = "Demo"
       lastName = "User" 
       email = "demo@company.com"
   } | ConvertTo-Json
   $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiUrl -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
   Write-Host "Your GUID: $($response.guid)"
   Write-Host "Service Token: $($response.serviceJwtToken)"
   ```
   
   **Swagger Customization**:
   ```yaml
   swagger: '2.0'
   info:
     title: Fabrikam MCP Server  # Optional: Customize title for better branding
     description: MCP Server for Fabrikam Business Operations

         parameters:
           - name: X-User-GUID
             in: header
             required: true
             type: string
             default: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-123456789012
             description: User tracking GUID for Disabled authentication mode

   ```
   
   **Replace the sample GUID** (`a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-123456789012`) with your actual generated GUID.
   
   **üîê Important Security Notes**:
   - The GUID acts as a user identifier in Disabled authentication mode
   - Each user/session should have a unique GUID for proper tracking
   - The MCP server will reject requests without a valid GUID format
     - https

   ```
   
   **Replace the sample GUID** (`a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-123456789012`) with your actual generated GUID.

   #### üîê **BearerToken Mode Customization** (Production-like Authentication)
   
   **When to use**: Production APIs, secure demos, when demonstrating JWT authentication
   
   **Required Changes in Swagger Editor**:
   1. **Update host**: Change to your MCP server domain
   2. **Add API Key security**: Configure JWT Bearer token authentication
   
   **üí° Domain Name Helper**: Your domain names follow the same pattern:
   - **Resource Group**: `rg-fabrikamaidemo-gcpm`
   - **API Domain**: `fabrikam-api-development-gcpm.azurewebsites.net` (for getting JWT tokens)
   - **MCP Domain**: `fabrikam-mcp-development-gcpm.azurewebsites.net` (for Swagger host)
   
   **Getting Your JWT Token**:
   1. Navigate to: `https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials`
   2. Use demo credentials to login at: `https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/login`
   3. Copy the `accessToken` from the response
   
   **üí° Troubleshooting Demo Credentials**:
   - If you get **HTTP 404** on `/api/auth/demo-credentials`, check your API is running: `https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/health`
   - If you get **HTTP 403** (Forbidden), your Azure environment might not be set to "Development"
   - Alternative: Check what environment is running: `https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/info`
   - **Demo credentials are only available in Development or dev environments for security**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Mode Specific Issues

#### üîì Disabled Mode Issues

**Custom Connector Creation Failed**
- Ensure you have proper permissions in Power Apps
- Verify your MCP server URL is accessible: `https://your-mcp-app-name.azurewebsites.net/mcp`
- Make sure **no authentication** is configured in the Security tab

**GUID Configuration Issues**
- Ensure you've generated a valid GUID using PowerShell or an online generator
- Verify the GUID format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- The GUID will be automatically passed as `userGuid` parameter in MCP requests

**Domain Name Issues**
- **Finding your domains**: Use the resource group suffix pattern:
  - Resource Group: `rg-fabrikamaidemo-SUFFIX` 
  - MCP Domain: `fabrikam-mcp-development-SUFFIX.azurewebsites.net`
  - API Domain: `fabrikam-api-development-SUFFIX.azurewebsites.net`
- Replace `SUFFIX` with your actual resource group suffix (e.g., `gcpm`, `demo`, etc.)

**No Data Returned in Disabled Mode**
- Verify your GUID is properly configured in the connector
- Check that the MCP server is running and accessible
- Try testing the connector directly in Power Apps

#### üîê BearerToken Mode Issues

**Authentication Failed**
- Ensure you've obtained a valid JWT token from `/api/auth/demo-credentials` and `/api/auth/login`
- Verify the Authorization header is set to: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Check that the JWT token hasn't expired (tokens expire after 60 minutes by default)

**Token Refresh Required**
- JWT tokens expire for security - get a new token from the login endpoint
- Consider implementing token refresh logic for production scenarios
- Demo credentials are available at: `https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials`

**Connector Security Configuration**
- Go to Security tab in Power Apps custom connector
- Select "API Key" authentication type
- Set Parameter location to "Header"
- Set Parameter name to "Authorization"

#### üè¢ EntraExternalId Mode Issues

**OAuth Configuration Failed**
- Verify your Entra External ID tenant configuration
- Ensure the client ID and client secret are correct
- Check that redirect URIs include your Copilot Studio callback URLs

**OAuth Flow Failed**
- Complete the OAuth consent flow in your browser
- Ensure your Entra application has proper permissions
- Verify the scope includes: `openid profile email`

**Token Validation Failed**
- Check that your Entra External ID tenant is properly configured
- Verify the OAuth endpoints are accessible
- Ensure the application registration includes necessary API permissions

### Common Issues (All Modes)

**Swagger Import Issues**
- Ensure you're using "Create from blank" instead of GitHub import
- Verify the host parameter matches your actual MCP server URL
- Replace `YOUR_MCP_SERVER_HOST` with your actual domain

**Connector Configuration Failed**
- Ensure Scheme is set to HTTPS
- Verify Host is set to your actual MCP app service domain (e.g., `fabrikam-mcp-dev-x1y2.azurewebsites.net`)
- **IMPORTANT**: Set Base URL to `/mcp` (standard MCP protocol endpoint)
- Test the connector connection from Power Apps

**"LimitTools" or "Limiting number of tools to 15" Errors**
- Copilot Studio has a maximum limit of 15 tools per custom connector
- The Fabrikam MCP server has been optimized to provide 12 consolidated business tools (well under the limit)
- **Consolidated tools include**:
  - **Executive**: GetBusinessDashboard, GetBusinessAlerts
  - **Sales**: GetOrders, GetSalesAnalytics, GetCustomers  
  - **Products**: GetProducts, GetProductAnalytics, GetInventoryOperations
  - **Support**: GetSupportTickets, GetCustomerServiceAnalytics, AddTicketNote, UpdateTicketStatus
- If you still see the error, ensure you're using the latest version of the custom connector
- Delete and recreate the custom connector if the tool count hasn't updated

**No Data Returned**
- The Fabrikam API simulates realistic business data with JSON seed files
- Data is generated dynamically for demonstration purposes
- If no results appear, try broader search criteria
- Verify your authentication mode is correctly configured
- Check that the custom connector actions are properly configured

**Tool Not Working**
- Verify the custom connector is properly connected in Tools settings
- Check that the action names match the available MCP functions
- Review agent instructions for proper tool usage guidance
- Test individual connector actions in Power Apps
- Ensure authentication is properly configured for your chosen mode
