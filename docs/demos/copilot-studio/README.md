# ü§ñ Copilot Studio Integration with Fabrikam MCP

Welcome to the complete guide for integrating Microsoft Copilot Studio with your Fabrikam Modular Homes MCP server. Choose the authentication approach that matches your needs.

## üéØ Quick Start Decision Tree

| Use Case | Authentication Mode | Guide | Setup Time |
|----------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| **Demo & Development** | Disabled | [No Authentication Setup](#-no-authentication-setup) | 15 minutes |
| **Production & Security** | JWT | [JWT Authentication Setup](#-jwt-authentication-setup) | 25 minutes |
| **Enterprise SSO** | Entra External ID | [Enterprise Setup](#-enterprise-setup-coming-soon) | Coming Soon |

## üîç Determine Your Authentication Mode

Check your Azure deployment output or use this API call:

```bash
curl -k https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/info
```

Look for the `authentication.mode` field in the response:
- `"Disabled"` ‚Üí Use No Authentication Setup
- `"BearerToken"` ‚Üí Use JWT Authentication Setup  
- `"EntraExternalId"` ‚Üí Use Enterprise Setup (coming soon)

## üìö Setup Guides

### üîì No Authentication Setup

**Quick Preview:**
- Get JWT token from demo user accounts
- Create agent with authenticated business instructions
- Configure secure custom connector with token headers
- Test with authenticated business queries

**Expected Setup Time:** 25 minutes

### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Setup (Coming Soon)

- Customer service interactions
- Inventory management queries
- Executive dashboard presentations

## üí° Best Practices

### Security Considerations

1. **Development vs Production**
   - Use disabled auth for development only
   - Always use JWT or Entra for production
   - Never expose production tokens in demos

2. **Token Management**
   - JWT tokens expire and need refresh
   - Store tokens securely in production
   - Use environment-specific configurations

3. **Agent Behavior**
   - Configure focused business instructions
   - Disable web search for controlled responses
   - Test thoroughly before workshops/demos

### Performance Optimization

1. **Connection Management**
   - Test connector connections before demos
   - Have backup plans for connection issues
   - Monitor MCP server availability

2. **Response Quality**
   - Train users on effective business queries
   - Provide sample questions for demos
   - Configure clear error handling

## üìû Support

### Quick Help

1. **Check Authentication Mode**: Use `/api/info` endpoint
2. **Validate MCP Connection**: Test connector in Power Apps
3. **Review Agent Instructions**: Ensure business focus is configured
4. **Test Sample Queries**: Use provided demo prompts
