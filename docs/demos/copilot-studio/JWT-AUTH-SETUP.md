# üîê Building a Fabrikam MCP Agent with JWT Authentication

This guide walks you through creating a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent that connects to your **JWT-authenticated** Fabrikam Modular Homes MCP server, enabling secure natural language interactions with business data.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Access to Power Apps for creating custom connectors
- Your Fabrikam platform deployed to Azure with **BearerToken Mode** enabled
- Your MCP Server URL (from Azure deployment output)
- Demo user credentials (we'll show you how to get these)
- Basic understanding of Copilot Studio interface

## üéØ What Your Agent Will Do

Your secure Fabrikam agent will enable business users to:
- **Sales Operations**: Query orders, track sales trends, analyze customer data
- **Inventory Management**: Check product availability, monitor stock levels, explore product catalog
- **Customer Service**: Manage support tickets, track resolution status, view customer issues

All interactions are authenticated and traced to specific users for security and auditing.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your JWT Token

Before setting up Copilot Studio, you need to get a JWT token from your Fabrikam API.

1. **Get Demo User Credentials**
   
   First, retrieve the demo user credentials from your API:
   
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials"
   ```
   
   **PowerShell Alternative**:
   ```powershell
   $credentials = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials"
   $credentials.demoUsers | Format-Table -Property name, email, password, roles
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Get JWT Token**
   
   Use the admin user credentials to get a JWT token:
   
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "lee.gu@fabrikam.levelupcsp.com",
       "password": "your-admin-password"
     }'
   ```
   
   **PowerShell Alternative**:
   ```powershell
   # Get demo credentials
   $creds = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials"
   $admin = $creds.demoUsers | Where-Object { $_.name -like "*Admin*" }
   
   # Login to get JWT token
   $loginBody = @{
       email = $admin.email
       password = $admin.password
   } | ConvertTo-Json
   
   $authResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/login" -Method POST -Body $loginBody -ContentType "application/json"
   
   Write-Host "JWT Token: $($authResponse.accessToken)"
   Write-Host "Expires At: $($authResponse.expiresAt)"
   ```

3. **Save Your JWT Token**
   
   From the response, save the `accessToken` value. It will look like:
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1laWQiOiIuLi4...
   ```

> **üîê Security Note**: JWT tokens expire after a configured time (usually 24 hours). For demos, you may need to refresh the token. In production, implement automatic token renewal.

### Step 2: Create a New Agent

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**üö´ "401 Unauthorized" responses**
- Check that your JWT token is valid and not expired
- Verify the token format includes "Bearer " prefix
- Ensure the token was generated correctly from the login endpoint
- Test the token directly against the API endpoints

**üö´ "Token expired" errors**
- Generate a new JWT token using the login process
- Update the connector connection with the new token
- Consider the token expiration time for demo planning

**üö´ "Forbidden" or permission errors**
- Verify the demo user has appropriate roles and permissions
- Check that the user account is active and not disabled
- Ensure the API endpoints support the authenticated user's access level

### Connection Issues

**üö´ Connector connection fails**
- Verify your MCP server URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the `/mcp/call` endpoint responds to authenticated POST requests
- Ensure your Azure MCP app is deployed and running with JWT authentication enabled
- Test the endpoint directly with curl using your JWT token

**üö´ Agent gives "access denied" responses**
- Confirm the custom connector is properly added to the agent
- Check that the JWT authentication is working (look at server logs)
- Verify the agent instructions are configured correctly
- Ensure the connection uses the correct JWT token format

### Security Validation

**üîê Verify JWT Authentication**
```bash
# Test your JWT token directly
curl -X GET "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/customers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**üîê Check Token Expiration**
```powershell
# Decode JWT to check expiration (requires JWT module)
$token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
$payload = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($token.Split('.')[1] + '=='))
$decoded = $payload | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Token expires: $(Get-Date -UnixTimeSeconds $decoded.exp)"
```

### Token Management

**Refreshing Expired Tokens**
```powershell
# Re-authenticate to get a fresh token
$creds = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/demo-credentials"
$admin = $creds.demoUsers | Where-Object { $_.name -like "*Admin*" }

$loginBody = @{
    email = $admin.email
    password = $admin.password
} | ConvertTo-Json

$authResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-api-app-name.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/login" -Method POST -Body $loginBody -ContentType "application/json"

Write-Host "New JWT Token: $($authResponse.accessToken)"
```
